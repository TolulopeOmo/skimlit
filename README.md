# skimlit
The goal of the dataset was to explore the ability for NLP models to classify sentences which appear in sequential order. Create an NLP model that categorizes abstract statements according to their function (e.g., objective, methods, outcomes, etc.) to allow scholars to skim through the literature (thus SkimLit) and delve deeper when needed.
